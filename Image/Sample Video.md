A slow cinematic pan inside a futuristic cybersecurity operations center, with glowing neon monitors
displaying streams of encrypted code, holographic interfaces floating in mid-air, and cybersecurity
analysts in dark clothing typing rapidly. The environment is illuminated with soft blue and purple neon
lighting, giving it a cyberpunk aesthetic. Outside the glass walls, a futuristic city skyline glows with tall
skyscrapers and flying cars in the night sky. Depth of field effect with sharp focus on the foreground and
blurred background city lights. The camera moves smoothly across the room, creating a dramatic,
professional look. Cinematic lighting, realistic details, slightly moody tone, 16:9 aspect ratio.

A short, cinematic 16:9 video of a humorous Filipino "tito" (uncle) type character. He’s wearing a slightly wrinkled office polo shirt or barong tagalog, standing in front of a small office server rack or messy network cables. He looks both confused and determined. He squints at the Ethernet cables, scratches his head, then randomly starts plugging and unplugging wires. The lights flicker, and he panics but pretends he knows what he's doing. Cut to a scene where he proudly says, “Ayos na 'yan!” then the whole office blackout then smokes comes out from server rack. Comedic timing, subtle background office chaos, and relatable IT or cybersecurity struggle vibes.
